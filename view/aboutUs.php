            <p class="text-justify"> A Digital agriculture Center is a service intended to provide agricultural
                products to consumers or retailers, making it easier for the consumer and retailer to
                focus on the farmer's produce according to their needs and for the farmer to sell his
                produce easily and as needed.The purpose of a Digital Agriculture Center is usually to
                solving problems about farmerâ€™s products, as well as customer can easily reach to farmers.
                This Digital Agriculture Center allows all farmers in the Ganewaththa in Kurunegala District
                to register on this web Application and publish an advertisement with all the details of
                their crops, this web Application will facilitate anyone in Sri Lanka to easily obtain the
                wholesale and retail agricultural products they need. A national curfew has been imposed on the activation of farmers' livelihoods,
                especially in connection with the current Covid19 epidemic. Restrictions on travel, however both
                prices of goods have gone up as consumers have disrupted normal market practices the balance between supply
                and intermittent demand has been broken. Some goods run out quickly as consumers buy in excess.

                <span class="ml-5"></span> Many fruits and vegetables in Sri Lanka were severely hampered in their supply of perishable
                fruits and vegetables during the harvest season. It can cause irreversible damage to the supply chain.
                Access to those goods is an important challenge when there are sufficient stocks.
                Delays in the distribution of fresh food to consumers lead to decay due to locking,
                which leads to food wastage and loss of farmers' profits. Fruit and vegetable centers affect farmers
                as well as consumers.
                <br><br>
                <span class="ml-5"></span> In response, we are experimenting with new ways of distribution with
                this application. In particular, it enables growers to deliver their produce to their customers
                at the right time without being wasted. Customers will also be able to purchase here without
                any hassle or shortage.
